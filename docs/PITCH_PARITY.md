# Pitch / Portico / MAK API parity notes

`pysdk/rti1516e/standard.py::Rti1516eAmbassador` is the "Layer 2"
sync ambassador mirroring IEEE 1516.1-2010 §6 `RTIambassador`. It
is what federates ported from a commercial RTI (Pitch HLA Evolved,
Portico, MAK RTI) should bind against.

This document records the places where gorti's Layer-2 surface
diverges from a strict reading of the spec, what's compatible
anyway, and what's explicitly out of scope.

## Compatible (gorti behaves as Pitch would)

- IEEE 1516.1 §4 Federation Management, §5 Declaration Management,
  §6 Object Management (minus reserveObjectInstanceName before M26 F),
  §7 Ownership Management, §8 Time Management, §9 DDM, §10.2 handle
  services. Method names follow Pitch's camelCase (`publishObjectClassAttributes`,
  `unconditionalAttributeOwnershipDivestiture`, etc.).
- FOM XML — gorti's parser accepts the IEEE 1516.2 standard form
  Pitch ships. Cross-language handle alignment is locked.
- mTLS + OIDC client authentication (M14) — bearer-token / cert
  args on `connect()`.

## Diverging (compatible API, different runtime behavior)

### `evokeCallback` / `evokeMultipleCallbacks` (§10.4) — M26 Phase E

Pitch defaults to `HLA_EVOKED`: callbacks fire ONLY when the
federate calls `rtiAmb.evokeCallback(min, max)`. gorti is
HLA_IMMEDIATE-flavored: callbacks fire from a background pump
as soon as events arrive.

`Rti1516eAmbassador.evokeCallback` is provided for API
compatibility. It yields to the loop for `approx_min_time`
seconds (up to `approx_max_time` if no callback fires in the
minimum), and returns `True` iff a callback fired in the window.

**The cheap implementation does not buffer callbacks.** A Pitch
federate that relies on "no callbacks fire outside evokeCallback"
will see callbacks at unexpected times under gorti. In practice,
federate code that just loops on `evokeMultipleCallbacks` and
dispatches overrides works correctly — the divergence is
observable only by federates that race on shared mutable state
across `evokeCallback` calls.

If a ported federate requires strict HLA_EVOKED semantics, raise
an issue and we'll add buffered-drain mode (the design is sketched
in `docs/M26_DISPATCH_PLAN.md` under "deferred to M27").

## Out of scope

- **Wire-format interop**: gorti uses gRPC; Pitch uses a proprietary
  RTI-internal TCP/multicast protocol. A gorti rtid cannot
  federate-join a Pitch RTI server or vice versa. See `docs/srs.md:255`
  and `docs/srs.md:326`.
- **Cross-RTI handle normalization** (§10): `normalizeFederateHandle`
  / `normalizeServiceGroup` are spec methods for federating across
  RTI implementations. Not applicable.
- **`getUpdateRateValueForAttribute`** (§10.2): rate-throttling is
  not implemented; per-class declared rates in the FOM are
  informational.
